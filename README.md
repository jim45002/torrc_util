# Torrc Utility
Torrc Utility is a simple Qt GUI for managing some options in Tor's configuration file. To learn about Tor go here https://www.torproject.org. This application was only tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS distro, with the default torrc file included with the Tor-Browser bundle. Before any changes are made to the torrc file, a copy is stored in the current directory. Torrc Utility is also used for graphically viewing the list of active Tor nodes. Double-click a name in the countries list to view its active nodes, and location on the GUI's map.

Torrc options supported are:

<ul>
  <li><b>ExcludeNodes</b>: List of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit</li>
  <li><b>ExitNodes</b>: List of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to use as exits</li>
  <li><b>EntryNodes</b>: list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to use for the first hop  </li>
 
 <li><b> HSLayer2Nodes</b>: A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes, and address patterns of nodes that are allowed to be used as the second hop in all client or service-side Onion Service circuits</li>

 <li><b> HSLayer3Nodes</b>: A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes, and address patterns of nodes that are allowed to be used as the third hop in all client and service-side Onion Service circuits</li>

<li><b>  ExcludeExitNodes</b>: A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network</li>

<li><b>  ExcludeExitNodes</b>: A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network</li>
 <li><b>EnforceDistinctSubnets</b>: If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are "too close" on the same circuit</li>

 <li><b>UseEntryGuards</b>: If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry servers, and try to stick with them</li>

 <li><b>NumEntryGuards</b>: If UseEntryGuards is set to 1, we will try to pick a total of NUM routers as long-term entries for our circuits</li>

 <li><b>StrictNodes</b>: If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat solely the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you (StrictNodes applies to neither ExcludeExitNodes nor to ExitNodes, nor to MiddleNodes). If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. </li>

</ul>


Only 2-letter country abbreviations and IPv4 node addresses are supported for node identities. See https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en for complete descritpion of these options.


# Build Instructions
This source code was built using the cmake build tool. How to build and usage instructions will be added to this repository soon. If you would like to build and run the application and have questions contact the Bitmessage address BM-2cWzE6TNpMDuaA9ZcLubBfxderyTsnKQ8n with any questions. This is a new repository so, please be patient.
